# FaceKart
Smarter Ad predictions using face detection and analysis through Machine Learning


In this era of data and privacy breach going hand in hand with annoying popups and irrelevant ads, FaceKart puts forth an anonymous input system, as well as predicting and providing accurate and relevant ads about the user's interests and/ or potential interests.


•	STEPS:

1.	FaceKart scans your face through a live feed from cameras, and our advanced face-analysing algorithms predict your age and gender based on the picture your webcam captures through our prototype.
2.	The result of the algorithm is used to accurately predict products that might pull your interest.



•	LANGUAGES USED:

	o	Python 3.6.6
	o	HTML5
	o	JavaScript
	o	CSS



•	DATASET USED- 
	UTKFace



•	FLOW OF THE APPLICATION:

	o	The model is trained using the dataset- UTKFace, using Age & Gender in the names of the names of photos.
	o	The trained model is then fed with live picture(s) of the end-user & relevant ads are put up on the webpage.
	o	Python is used on the back-end, along with HTML5, JS & CSS in the front-end.
